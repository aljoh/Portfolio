### Portfolio Challenge
Craft Academy Week 3 Challenge  
This is my submission  

## Information
This is a portfolio. It's deployed on http://aljoh.surge.sh with the help of **Middleman**, a framework for building static websites. With Middleman I have made use of a layout and partials to keep my code **DRY**. For styling I have used **Bootstrap**, a library for html, css and javascript, and **SASS**.
I used **HAML** as the template engine for this project, which let me write markup in a shorter and more concise way.
