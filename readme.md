### Portfolio Challenge
Craft Academy Week 3 Challenge  
This is my submission  

## Information
This is a portfolio. It's deployed on aljoh.surge.sh with the help of **Middleman**, a framework for building static websites. For styling I have used **Bootstrap**, a library for html, css and javascript, and **Sass**.  
I used **HAML** as the template engine for this project, which let me write HTML in a shorter and more concise way.
