  gather: This is a smart journal app built with Ionic for mobile devices, IOS and Android. It lets you tag your entries with labels and sentiment, which then categorizes them based on your tags. It also provides statistics for your entries, which we have visualized with charts and graphs using chart.js. Back end built with Ruby on Rails.
  slowfood: Three weeks during the bootcamp I was part of building two slowfood applications. Basically websites for ordering food from multiple restaurants. We used gmaps to place restaurants on a dynamic map and stripe for credit card payment. Built with TDD using rspec and cucumber.
  istory: This was our midcourse project built in one week, thus it's still very much WIP. It's a website to read and create interactive stories, basically stories where the reader makes choices. Built on Ruby on Rails with TDD using rspec and cucumber.
  me: Until fairly recently, I spent most of my evenings trying to teach myself programming, mostly using Python. This eventually lead to a bootcamp at Craft Academy in Gothenburg, where I had the opportunity to learn an incredible amount. The focus has been on producing reliable products using agile methods and TDD, leaning strongly towards web development.
  me_2: I am mostly familiar with Ruby (Ruby on Rails) and Javascript (Typescript, Angular) but I am currently teaching myself .NET development using C#.
  me_3: From my time at Craft Academy, I consider my biggest takeaway the fact that I've really discovered a passion for programming and the realization that I have a lifelong quest of continuous learning ahead of me. Check out my Github to see what I've been up to so far.
  me_personal: Outside work, I'm a lover of food, powerlifting and videogames. I also have a big passion for adventure and nature, with lots of skiing and traveling on my belt.
