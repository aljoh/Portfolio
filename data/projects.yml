  gather: This is a smart journal app built with Ionic for mobile devices, IOS and Android. It lets you tag your entries with labels and sentiment, which then categorizes them based on your tags. It also provides statistics for your entries, which we have visualized with charts and graphs using chart.js. Back end built with Ruby on Rails.
  slowfood: Three weeks during the bootcamp I was part of building two slowfood applications. Basically websites for ordering food from multiple restaurants. We used gmaps to place restaurants on a dynamic map and stripe for credit card payment. Built with TDD using rspec and cucumber.
  istory: This was my first project using Jasmine for TDD, Test Driven Development. The program lets you calculate your BMI, or Body Mass Index, using your height and weight as parameters. The program lets you choose between calculating with the metric and imperial system, and performs an accurate calculation based on your choice. With the help of i18n I have added a language switch aswell, letting you choose seeing the application in english or swedish. Written in Javascript and tested with Jasmine, Bootstrap and Jquery for styling.
  me: Until fairly recently, I spent most of my evenings trying to teach myself programming, mostly using Python. This eventually lead to a bootcamp at Craft Academy in Gothenburg, where I had the opportunity to learn an incredible amount. The focus has been on producing reliable products using agile methods and TDD, leaning strongly towards web development.
  me_2: I am mostly familiar with Ruby (Ruby on Rails) and Javascript (Typescript, Angular) but I am currently teaching myself .NET development using C#.
  me_3: From my time at Craft Academy, I consider my biggest takeaway the fact that I've really discovered a passion for programming and the realization that I have a lifelong quest of continuous learning ahead of me. Check out my Github to see what I've been up to so far.
  me_personal: Outside work, I'm a lover of food, powerlifting and videogames. I also have a big passion for adventure and nature, with lots of skiing and traveling on my belt.
